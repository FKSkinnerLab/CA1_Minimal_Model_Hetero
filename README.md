# CA1_Minimal_Model_Hetero

Anton Lunyov (uploaded June 2020), code from summer 2017+

Language: python

## Summary ##

This repository includes python code and scripts that 
i. generates the model database (a,b,d,klow parameters), along with the generated model database output (TO ADD FILE NAMES)
ii. obtains SFA, Rheo, PIR metrics from model database

Izhikevich cellular model equations based on strongly adapting CA1 pyramidal cell model; E-I network simulations done via brian2 softwared.
